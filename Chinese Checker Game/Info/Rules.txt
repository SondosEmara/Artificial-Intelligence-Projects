Chinese checkers can be played by up to 6 players. However, we will implement only a 2 players game
version for this project. The game board is basically a star with six edges. Each edge contains a different
colored set of 10 marbles as seen in the above picture. The first player will own three colored sets and the
second player will own the remaining three colored sets.
For example:
● Player 1 will own Green, Blue and Purple sets
● Player 2 will own Red, Orange and Yellow sets

The object of the Chinese checkers is to get all of your marbles to the opposite point of the star. The first
player to do this wins.
For example, For player 1 to win:
1. He must move all green marbles to the other opposite side of the star (Replacing red marbles).
2. He must move all blue marbles to the other opposite side of the star(Replacing orange marbles)
3. He must move all purble marbles to the other opposite side of the star(Replacing yellow purple
marbles)
How the game goes on
Players take turns moving their pieces across the board. During a player’s turn:
1. They can move their piece to any adjacent empty hole

2. A player’s piece can also hop over an adjacent piece, into an empty hole. That piece can be their
own colored piece or the opponent piece. The player can continually hop over subsequent pieces
during that turn, and in any direction, as long as there are empty holes on the other side of those
pieces
