P1:
Get the number of students who have taken a specific course.
Examples:
?- numStudents('Algorithms', Num).
Num = 0
?- numStudents('Math 1', Num).
Num = 4

P2:
Get the maximum grade that a specific student was able to obtain.
Examples:
?- maxStudentGrade(stud10, MaxGrade).
MaxGrade = 97
?- maxStudentGrade(stud08, MaxGrade).
MaxGrade = 71

P3:
Get a list containing the sequence of courses that a student needs to take in order to
be able to take the target course. The query must only succeed if the student has
already taken and successfully passed a course that can directly or indirectly lead to
the target.
Examples:
?- remainingCourses(stud01, 'Advanced Algorithms', Courses).
Courses = ['OOP', 'Data Structures', 'Algorithms']
?- remainingCourses(stud07, 'Electronics 2', Courses).
false.
?- remainingCourses(stud02, 'Networks', Courses).
Courses = []
?- remainingCourses(stud05, 'Computer Architecture', Courses).
Courses = ['Electronics 2']
?- remainingCourses(stud08, 'Data Warehouses', Courses).
false.
